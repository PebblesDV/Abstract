# Abstract

This is a simple random abstract art generator

By clicking on the "backspace" button, the art will randomize

The shapes I used are rectangles, ellipses, triangles and lines

The amount you see on the screen, the color, the size, the strokeweight and strokecolor, and the x and y co√∂rdinates of each shape change every time
